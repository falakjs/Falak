# Falak JS
> Falak Js Framework, A framework for lazy people.


# Why Falak
Well, there are many outstanding frameworks such as `Angular`, `React` or `Vue` that can be used to develop a web application.

But why falak? let's see what makes it different from other frameworks.

- Can develop more than application in one workspace, for example the website and the admin panel.
- Almost everything is automated here `javascript`, `sass` and `html` files, you don't have to **require** or **import** any javascript files to use it over and over.
- No need to duplicate assets like `logos`, images, icons or even style codes between all applications that you'll develop for one website, there is a `common` application to communicate between all applications and share any **common** data/files.
- Supporting multi languages by default **Localization**. 
- Supporting both style directions by default so you won't have to worry about writing two designs one for `LTR` and another for `RTL` version.  
- Easy to understand, and use.
- The development server is a lightweight one.
- Production doesn't take much time and can compile one or all applications in same time.
- Generating `.htaccess` files for Apache servers thus you won't have to look for one by yourself.  
- Too many packages that help you in your development.
- No complicated relations between components.
